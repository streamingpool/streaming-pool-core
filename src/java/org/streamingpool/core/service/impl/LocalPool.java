/**
 * Local pool for providing and discovery of {@link Publisher}s. (this class is both a {@link DiscoveryService} and a
 * {@link ProvidingService}). The most important feature of the {@link LocalPool} is that it supports the lazy creation
 * of the streams, specifically, they are created when discovered using {@link StreamFactory}s. When a {@link StreamId}
 * is discovered, the discovery is delegated to a new instance of {@link TrackKeepingDiscoveryService}. The
 * {@link TrackKeepingDiscoveryService} then tries to create the stream using the provided {@link TypedStreamFactory}s
 * if no matching {@link StreamId} has already been provided.
